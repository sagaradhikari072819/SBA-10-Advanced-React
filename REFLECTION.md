README.md: The repository must include a README.md file that contains:
A brief description of the application and its features.
Ans: All folders are inside the src folder, api/, components/, context/, hooks/, & page/ has all the needed files. App.tsx and main.tsx files contains logic as well.


Instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project locally.
Ans: This Recipe Discovery App is a React-based single-page application for browsing recipes, viewing detailed instructions, searching meals, and saving personal favorites. Built with modern React patterns, custom hooks, context state management, routing, and integration with TheMealDB API.

Reflection: A short section in your README.md or in a separate REFLECTION.md file detailing:
The most challenging part of the project for you.
Ans: The challenging part of this project was planning. It's easier to keep writing all the logics and mapping in one place, but then it will become difficult to maintain and debug.



A brief explanation of a design decision you made (e.g., why you structured a hook a certain way, how you decided to manage a piece of state).
Ans: I desided to write hooks to reuse the codes and context to make props available to all pages. I used useState to manage a piece of state.
